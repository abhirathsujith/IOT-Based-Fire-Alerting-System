# IOT-Based-Fire-Alerting-System
Using Thingspeak API.  


Connect the wires and upload the code to the Arduino UNO. Place a lighted lighter or a match stick in
front of the flame sensor to check its operation. The Flame Sensor's output is HIGH under normal
conditions. When a fire is detected, the sensor's output turns LOW. The Buzzer is activated when Arduino
detects a LOW signal on its input pin. The sensor, led, and buzzer are now ready to detect a flame or fire.
If we set a fire or flame in front of the sensor, the sensor detects it, and the buzzer sounds an alert with a
light led to notify the incidence of the fire, which is then relayed to the Thingspeak website through the
use of the GSM module.
